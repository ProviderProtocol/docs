# UPP-1.1 Specification

<Badge text="Version 1.1.0-draft" variant="note" />

The Unified Provider Protocol (UPP) is a first-generation standard for simplifying AI inference and enabling multi-provider interoperability.

## Abstract

UPP defines uniform interfaces for interacting with Large Language Models, Embedding Models, Image Generation Models, and other AI inference APIs through modality-specific, consistent developer experiences.

The protocol provides separate entry points for each modality—`llm()`, `embedding()`, `image()`—while sharing common provider infrastructure, configuration patterns, and design principles.

  See the [API Reference](/api/overview) for the ProviderProtocol library, a compliant implementation of UPP-1.1.

## Purpose

Modern AI development requires interacting with multiple providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Stability, Voyage, etc.), each with distinct APIs, authentication schemes, and response formats. UPP-1.1 establishes a standard protocol that:

- Provides modality-specific interfaces (`llm`, `embedding`, `image`)
- Enables provider switching without application code changes
- Maintains provider-native configuration to avoid abstraction leakage
- Shares common infrastructure (auth, retry, HTTP) across modalities
- Supports text, image, audio, video, embeddings, and future modalities

## Scope

This specification covers:

- The `llm()` function interface (chat/completion)
- The `embedding()` function interface (vector embeddings)
- The `image()` function interface (image generation)
- Provider adapter requirements for each modality
- Shared infrastructure (ProviderConfig, KeyStrategy, error handling)
- Message, Turn, and Thread data structures (LLM-specific)
- Streaming response handling
- Tool definition and execution

## Modality Overview

| Entry Point | Purpose | Example Models |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| `llm()` | Chat, completion, reasoning | Claude, GPT-4, Gemini |
| `embedding()` | Vector embeddings | text-embedding-3, Voyage, Cohere |
| `image()` | Image generation/editing | DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Imagen |

Future modalities may include:
- `audio()` - Speech-to-text, text-to-speech
- `video()` - Video generation

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Provider** | A vendor-specific adapter exposing one or more modality interfaces |
| **Modality** | A distinct AI capability: LLM, embedding, image generation, etc. |
| **BoundModel** | A model instance bound to a specific provider and model ID |
| **Message** | A single message in an LLM conversation (user, assistant, or tool result) |
| **Turn** | The complete result of one LLM inference call, containing all messages produced |
| **StreamEvent** | A streaming event (lifecycle or content delta) |
| **Thread** | A utility class for managing LLM conversation history |
| **Embedding** | A vector representation of text or other content |
| **UPP** | Unified Provider Protocol |

## Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this specification are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).
